Business problem

Mary is the owner of a small pharmacy located in a busy city center. She has been running the pharmacy for the past few years and has noticed that sales have stagnated. Despite the competitive pricing, Mary's Pharmacy has struggled to attract new customers.

To try and improve her business, Mary decided to contact Datafied Technologies to conduct a thorough analysis of her sales data using the transactional data collected over the past 6 years. She exports the data from her Point-of-Sale system, which includes information on the date and time of each sale, the name of the pharmaceutical drug sold, and the quantity of each drug sold.

You are the senior data analyst at Datafied Technologies. You are required to come up with business questions and generate metrics that could be tracked to identify trends and patterns in the sale of pharmaceutical drugs sold in the pharmacy over time. You also need to visualize the data and create dashboards to uncover hidden insights and track the metrics you have defined for the business.

Mary needs your help to uncover valuable insights about her business and take action to improve its performance. Mary intends to use this newfound knowledge to make informed decisions about her inventory and marketing strategies, ultimately leading to an increase in sales and the growth of her business.

Dataset information

The dataset is built from the initial dataset consisting of transactional data collected in 6 years (period 2014-2019), indicating the date and time of sale, pharmaceutical drug brand name, and sold quantity, exported from the Point-of-Sale system in the individual pharmacy. The selected group of drugs from the dataset (57 drugs) is classified into the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System categories:

M01AB - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic acid derivatives, and related substances
M01AE - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic acid derivatives
N02BA - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives
N02BE/B - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides
N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
N05C - Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics, and sedatives drugs
R03 - Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
R06 - Antihistamines for systemic use
Data Source: Pharm Dataset

Project Objective

The objective of the project was to help Mary's Pharmacy improve its sales performance and overall business operations by analyzing transactional sales data and then creating dashboard(s) that provide valuable insights to the sales manager and CEO. The dashboard should uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities in the sale of pharmaceutical drugs, enabling informed decision-making and driving business growth.

Throughout the project, we were able to achieve the following:

Understand Business Objectives and User Requirements

We tried to understand the specific requirements and objectives from the business problem. We identified key areas we want to focus on and the questions the business needs answers to.

Define Business Questions and Metrics

Based on the discussions in Step 1, we defined specific business questions that the dashboard should answer. Example questions include:

What is the overall sales trend for the pharmacy?
Which drugs have the highest sales revenue?
Are there any seasonal sales patterns for specific drugs or ATC categories?
What time of the day has the highest sales?
Define the metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will help answer the business questions.

Example metrics include:

Total sales revenue
Quantity sold by drug or ATC category
Sales growth rate
Top-selling drugs by revenue or quantity
Quantity growth rate..
Preprocess the dataset:

The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates, correcting any inconsistencies, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
